	<h2>Favorites</h2><hr>
	<p>We all have things we really like and here are the list of my personal favorites that I would like to share.</p><br>
	<ol>
		<li><h3>FILM</h3>
			<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="princessmononoke.jpg" alt="Princess Mononoke Film Cover" align="center" height="300"/></p>
			<p>One of my favorite films is directed and created by Hayao Miyazaki. The studio, <em>Studio Ghibli Films</em>, has great success in making highest gross feature films worldwide. As a matter of fact, all of his creation or been part of his career also became my favorite, but there is one that I have been watched for many times entitled <strong>Princess Mononoke</strong>. This film is all about a human girl that adopted by the pack of wolves due to decision of leaving the child by her parents and then acquire of willingness to sacrifice her life as became part of the nature. She is very persistent and brave to fight to her own species against the abusive traits of human behavior towards the forest and gods. Also there’s this boy who went along from the far north east part of indigenous people to travel all the way to the west to cure his cursed arms. The boy has the spirit of protecting both human and nature; he helps who he would see. Together, they both tried to save the worlds from its sudden destruction on the domineering of human. Basically the conflict to the story is a man versus the nature. One side keeps dominating, and thus how this reflects in our real situation, and human.</p></li>
		<li><h3>COLOR</h3>
			<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="sky.jpg" alt="Blue Sky" align="center" height="250"/></p>
			<p><strong>Sky Blue</strong> has the only one who I would top to my color tier list. Funny story that when I was like five years old I heard the other girls in particular that they like pink which I didn’t understand why they do like it and so I got along with the stereotype that girls will always pick pink as their favorite. But honestly, sky truly pleasing my eyes everywhere I would look up to, except when the sun is directly just above. It comforts me and feels like want to watch it while figuring does cloud imitate. Although some certain shaded yellow, green, brown and red are also my likes, though not enough to feel me at ease.</p></li>
		<li><h3>SONG</h3>

			<p>When it comes to song, I am not very biased. My favorite comes changing simultaneously, depending on my daily lives. What I like listening right now is <strong>Daydream by Aurora</strong>. Due to pandemic, I am kind of missing go outside the house and bond with my friends, so I just accidentally discover the song.</p></li>
		<li><h3>FOOD</h3>
			<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="food.jpg" alt="Seafood and Chocolate" align="center" height="250"/></p>
			<p>Who would not like <strong>chocolate</strong>? Probably it's one of those who don’t like sweets. Without this <em> food of the gods</em>, my life would never been better. Well, indeed chocolates may aim to various complications to other people, like obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Although we cannot deny that chocolates can lift up our mood no matter how bad the day could be possible. Another food that I like is seafood, specifically <strong>shrimp and crabs</strong>. Fortunately, I never had any allergic reaction ever since I started eating it.</p></li>
		<li><h3>NOVEL</h3>
			<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="projectloki.jpg" alt="Project Loki Layout" align="center" height="200"/></p>
			<p>I like spending time reading with books, any genre would be favorable to me. But of all the books I read, fiction or non-fiction, <strong>Project Loki</strong> remains at my most favorite novel. The novel was officially published to a web app global community from the beginning, then later been released in paperback to one of the known publishing company. It is written by Rheinlander Musni or also known as <em>“Cris Ibarra”</em>. The story is inspired to a famous novel from Conan Doyle, <em>Sherlock Holmes”</em> and one of sensational anime series, <em>Detective Conan</em>. It has mystery plot, involving a detective club consisting of four student members to prevail the mystery of cases happening inside and outside their school ground and fought against their nemesis along with the companion to move the piece of chess according to his plan. The story plot intrigues me despite of failing to determine what the mystery behind the curtain. I have many things I learned and make me improve to be wise and better person.</p></li>
